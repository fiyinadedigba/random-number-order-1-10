## Description

This task focuses on designing a monitoring strategy for a high-performance server with the following specifications:

- 4 times Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E7-4830 v4 @ 2.00GHz
- 64GB of ram
- 2 tb HDD disk space
- 2 x 10Gbit/s nics 

The server is responsible for **SSL offloading** and handling approximately **25,000 requests per second**, making it both **CPU-intensive** and **network-intensive**.

The goal is to ensure **high availability, low latency, and system reliability** through effective monitoring.

## Key Metrics to Monitor

### 1. CPU Metrics

- CPU utilization (per core)
- User vs system CPU time
- Load average
- Context switches

**Why:**  
SSL/TLS encryption and decryption are CPU-intensive operations. High CPU usage can directly impact request latency and throughput.

---

### 2. Memory Metrics

- Total memory usage
- Free vs used memory
- Cache and buffer usage
- Swap usage (should remain near zero)

**Why:**  
Memory pressure can lead to swapping, significantly degrading performance.

---

### 3. Network Metrics

- Throughput (bytes in/out per second)
- Packets per second
- Packet drops and errors
- Interface utilization per NIC

**Why:**  
With 10 Gbit/s interfaces, network bottlenecks or packet loss can severely impact performance and request handling.

---

### 4. Disk I/O Metrics

- Read/write throughput
- IOPS
- Disk latency

**Why:**  
Although SSL offloading is mostly in-memory, logging and buffering operations may introduce disk I/O overhead.

---

### 5. Application-Level Metrics

- Requests per second (RPS)
- Latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rates (4xx, 5xx)
- Active and idle connections

**Why:**  
These metrics reflect the **end-user experience** and overall system health.

---

### 6. SSL/TLS Metrics

- TLS handshake rate
- Handshake failures
- Session reuse rate
- TLS version distribution

**Why:**  
TLS handshakes are computationally expensive. Poor session reuse increases CPU load.

---

## Monitoring Implementation

### Using Zabbix

Monitoring can be implemented using **Zabbix**, which provides a comprehensive platform for system and application monitoring.

#### System Monitoring

- Deploy Zabbix agents on the server
- Collect:
  - CPU usage (per core)
  - Memory usage
  - Disk I/O
  - Network statistics

#### Network Monitoring

- Monitor NIC throughput and packet drops
- Use SNMP (if required) for network-level visibility

#### Application Monitoring

- Define custom Zabbix items for:
  - Requests per second
  - Latency metrics
  - Error rates

#### Extensibility with Scripts

Custom **Bash or Python scripts** can be integrated with Zabbix to collect advanced metrics such as:

- TLS handshake statistics  
- Application-specific performance data

### Alternative Monitoring Stack (Prometheus & Grafana)

In addition to Zabbix, a modern monitoring stack can also be implemented using:

- Prometheus for metrics collection and time-series storage  
- Grafana for visualization and dashboards  

This approach is particularly useful for:
- High-resolution, real-time metrics
- Flexible querying (PromQL)
- Advanced visualization and alerting

In some environments, Prometheus and Grafana can complement or replace traditional monitoring systems depending on scalability and operational requirements.

## Alerting Strategy

Effective alerting is critical for proactive incident management.

### Example Triggers

- CPU usage > 85% (sustained)
- Packet drops detected on network interfaces
- Latency (p95/p99) exceeds threshold
- Error rates increase beyond acceptable limits
- Memory usage nearing capacity or swap activity detected

### Notifications

- Email alerts
- Integration with incident management tools (e.g., Slack, PagerDuty)

---

## Challenges of Monitoring

### 1. High Throughput

Handling 25,000 requests per second requires **low-overhead monitoring** to avoid impacting performance.

---

### 2. Data Volume

Large volumes of logs and metrics require efficient storage, aggregation, and visualization strategies.

---

### 3. Latency Sensitivity

Small performance degradations can significantly impact user experience. High-resolution monitoring is required.

---

### 4. Network Complexity

High-speed (10 Gbit/s) interfaces can experience short-lived spikes (microbursts) that are difficult to detect.

---

### 5. SSL Overhead

TLS handshakes introduce CPU spikes, especially during traffic bursts.

---

### 6. Correlation of Metrics

Effective monitoring requires correlating:

- System metrics (CPU, memory)
- Network metrics
- Application-level metrics  

---

## Summary

To effectively monitor a high-performance SSL offloading server:

- Focus on **CPU, network, and application metrics**
- Use a robust monitoring platform such as **Zabbix**
- Extend monitoring capabilities with **custom scripts where necessary**
- Implement **proactive alerting**
- Address challenges related to **scale, latency, and data volume**

This approach ensures **system reliability, performance optimization, and rapid incident response** in a production environment.
