## Description

This task focuses on designing a monitoring strategy for a high-performance server with the following specifications:

- 4 times Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E7-4830 v4 @ 2.00GHz
- 64GB of ram
- 2 tb HDD disk space
- 2 x 10Gbit/s nics 

The server is responsible for **SSL offloading** and handling approximately **25,000 requests per second**, making it both **CPU-intensive** and **network-intensive**.

The goal is to ensure **high availability, low latency, and system reliability** through effective monitoring.

## Key Metrics to Monitor

### 1. CPU Metrics

- CPU utilization (per core)  
- User vs system CPU time  
- Load average  
- Context switches  

**Why:**

- **CPU utilization (per core):** Indicates how busy each core is. High usage across all cores may lead to increased latency in SSL processing.  
- **User vs system CPU time:** Helps distinguish between application load (user) and kernel/network overhead (system).  
- **Load average:** Shows the number of processes waiting for CPU. Values higher than the number of CPU cores indicate overload.  
- **Context switches:** High rates may indicate excessive process switching, reducing efficiency under high concurrency.  

---

### 2. Memory Metrics

- Total memory usage  
- Free vs used memory  
- Cache and buffer usage  
- Swap usage  

**Why:**  
Memory pressure and swap usage can significantly degrade performance, especially under high request rates.

---

### 3. Network Metrics

- Throughput (bytes in/out per second)  
- Packets per second  
- Packet drops and errors  
- Interface utilization per NIC  

**Why:**  
With 10 Gbit/s interfaces, network bottlenecks or packet loss directly impact request handling and latency.

---

### 4. Disk I/O Metrics

- Read/write throughput  
- IOPS  
- Disk latency  

**Why:**  
Although SSL offloading is primarily CPU-bound, logging and buffering can introduce disk overhead.

---

### 5. Application-Level Metrics

- Requests per second (RPS)  
- Latency (p50, p95, p99)  
- Error rates (4xx, 5xx)  
- Active connections  

**Why:**  
These metrics reflect the **end-user experience** and service health.

---

### 6. SSL/TLS Metrics

- TLS handshake rate  
- Handshake failures  
- Session reuse rate  

**Why:**  
TLS handshakes are computationally expensive and can significantly increase CPU load.

---

## Monitoring Implementation

Monitoring can be implemented using a modern observability stack:

- Prometheus for metrics collection and time-series storage  
- Node Exporter for system-level metrics  
- Application exporters (e.g., NGINX, HAProxy)  
- Grafana for dashboards and visualization  

This approach provides **high-resolution, real-time monitoring and flexible querying**.

---

### Alternative Approach (Zabbix)

In environments where Zabbix is used, similar monitoring can be achieved using:

- Zabbix agents for system metrics  
- Custom items for application-level metrics  
- Built-in alerting and dashboards  

Zabbix provides an integrated solution for infrastructure monitoring and alerting.

---

## Tooling and Observability Approach

Monitoring should combine system-level tools, centralized metrics, and logging.

### System-Level Monitoring

- `top`, `htop` → real-time CPU and memory usage  
- `vmstat`, `iostat`, `sar` → performance trends  
- `netstat`, `ss` → network connections and socket statistics  

These tools are useful for **on-host diagnostics and incident response**.

---

### Metrics Collection (Production)

- Prometheus + Node Exporter → system metrics  
- Application exporters → request rate, latency, errors  
- Grafana → dashboards and visualization  

---

### Logging & Tracing

- Centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack) → log aggregation and analysis  
- Request tracing → end-to-end latency visibility  

These are critical for debugging and understanding system behaviour under load.

---

## Alerting Strategy

Effective alerting enables proactive incident response.

### Example Triggers

- CPU usage > 85% (sustained)  
- Packet drops detected on network interfaces  
- High latency (p95/p99 thresholds exceeded)  
- Increased error rates  
- Memory exhaustion or swap activity  

### Notifications

- Email alerts  
- Integration with tools such as Slack or PagerDuty  

---

## Challenges of Monitoring

### High Throughput

Handling 25,000 requests per second requires low-overhead monitoring to avoid impacting performance.

### Data Volume

Large volumes of metrics and logs require efficient storage and aggregation.

### Latency Sensitivity

Small performance degradations can significantly affect user experience.

### Network Complexity

High-speed interfaces may experience microbursts that are difficult to detect.

### SSL Overhead

TLS handshakes can introduce CPU spikes during traffic bursts.

### Metric Correlation

Effective monitoring requires correlating system, network, and application metrics to identify root causes.

## Summary

To effectively monitor a high-performance SSL offloading server:

- Focus on CPU, network, and application-level metrics  
- Use Prometheus and Grafana for scalable, real-time monitoring  
- Leverage Zabbix where required for integrated infrastructure monitoring  
- Combine metrics, logs, and tracing for full observability  
- Implement proactive alerting to ensure rapid incident response  

This approach ensures reliability, performance, and scalability in a production environment.
